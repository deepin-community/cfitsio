Comment:
 The cfitsio Debian package is patched to use the system cfortran package
 instead of the above file.
 .
 The author of cfortran has subsequently stated that cfortran.h may optionally
 be used and distributed under the GNU Library General Public License (LGPL).
 This statement was made in an email to Kevin McCarty, which is reproduced
 below:

 Subject: Re: CFortran licensing question
 .
 Kevin,
 .
 [Just noticed that I didn't send this yesterady.]
 .
 I have no time right now to read through licenses.
 IIRC, library GPL is fairly unrestrictive, so I'll choose that. So.....
 .
 You may consider this e-mail as a notice that as an alternative to any
 other cfortran licenses,
 I hereby relase all versions and all parts of cfortran under the
 the Library GPL license.
 From among these licenses, the user is free to choose
 the license or licenses under which cfortran is used.
 .
 Contact me if you'd like to be able to choose another license.
 .
